I'm the Co-founder, CEO, and Chief Category Officer of Inara where you only pay for what you read, one page at a time—and when the page turns, the author earns. The end of eBooks sales and subscriptions. 


SUMMARY

We solve readers' ebook discovery problem and authors' revenue-earning and reader engagement problem—you only pay for
what you read, one page at a time—when the page turns, the author earns—the End of Ebooks Sales and Subscriptions.

DESCRIPTION

Readers must buy the book or subscribe to a service to find that the book isn’t right for them. Authors pay an “ad tax” on their revenue and give away free ebooks but fail to attract enough readers. With Inara, you only pay for what you read one page at a time. When the page turns the author earns. The bar to reader ebook discovery falls and authors get paid whether the reader reads one page or five hundred in any order.
With Inara, open an ebook on our progressive web application, turn the ebook page, and a micropayment goes from the reader’s digital wallet to the author’s digital
wallet in real time. We have Hedera Hashgraph 3rd generation Distributed Ledger Technology and the Dropp
payment solution that enable micropayment transactions in USD and HBAR crypto. Inara's proprietary technology renders the book file so that with each text display, we
calculate the micropayment charge.
We are pre-seed and entering Open Beta. Inara is an alumnus of the Hedera Boost startup program and an official Hedera Use Case. We are in development of the solution for audio/books and e-book NFTs, and streaming video micropayments to the Metaverse in a virtual land connecting creators and users in MetaraWorld.
